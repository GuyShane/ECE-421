Augmentations:
  - The block for the file monitoring commands also takes ruby commands instead of just shell commands.

Extra Testing:
  - Checked if all the flags for each command can be handled
  - Checked each command if it exists in our shell

Limitations:
  - The file monitoring commands can only take one file/directory at at time
  - The input typed before a delayed background process wakes up will not be displayed in the new line but it will be executed if enter is pressed.
